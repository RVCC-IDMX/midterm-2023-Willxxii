      <p>
        My name is Will Sisler, and I’ve been a web design programmer for the past 8 years. Being the creator of several websites for multi-million dollar companies, it’s easy to see why they call me the best. I am incredibly proud of all the achievements I have accomplished, and the people I’ve met along the way. I would like to thank the academy, my clients, and my friends and family who have supported me as I climbed the IDMX225 ladder. As an expression of gratitude, I have created this website to show the world how awesome my code is. Welcome… to WillXXII Awesome Midterm Website.
